## Guess Game Application

**Guess Game By Bhumi Jain**

A simple Java-based game where players guess a randomly generated number. The program provides hints like **"too high"** or **"too low"** and displays the total number of attempts when the correct number is guessed. This project is perfect for practicing Java basics such as loops and conditionals.

## 🎯 Overview

The Guess Game is a console-based Java program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number, providing helpful feedback after each attempt.

## ✨ Features

* Random number generation
* User input for guessing numbers
* Hints: **Too High** / **Too Low**
* Displays total attempts after correct guess
* Simple and beginner-friendly console interface

## 🔄 How It Works

1. The program generates a random number.
2. The user enters a guess.
3. The program checks the guess and prints:

   * "Too High" if the guess is greater than the number
   * "Too Low" if the guess is smaller than the number
4. When the user guesses correctly, the program displays the number of attempts.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Limit the number of attempts
* Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
* GUI version using Java Swing
* High score tracking system
